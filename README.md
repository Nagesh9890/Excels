1. Overview
Purpose: WML Experiments help in managing the lifecycle of model training and evaluation. It's especially useful when you're training multiple models, tuning hyperparameters, or want to keep track of various model versions.
Integration: It's tightly integrated with other Watson Studio features, allowing seamless transition from data preprocessing to model deployment.
2. Key Features
Training Runs: You can initiate multiple training runs with different configurations and hyperparameters.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Automatically search for the best hyperparameters for your model to improve accuracy or performance.
Model Evaluation: After training, models are automatically evaluated based on metrics relevant to the algorithm (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, etc.).
Model Comparison: Easily compare different models or training runs to select the best performing one.
Versioning: Keep track of different versions of your models, including the data and hyperparameters used.
Visualization: Visualize training metrics over time to understand model convergence and performance.
3. Workflow
Setup: Define the model, the algorithm, and any hyperparameters you want to use.
Run: Initiate the training run. This can be a single run with specified parameters or an optimization run where the system searches for the best hyperparameters.
Monitor: Track the progress of the training run in real-time, observing metrics and performance indicators.
Evaluate: Once training is complete, review the performance metrics of the model.
Compare: If you have multiple models or runs, compare them to select the best one.
Deploy: Once satisfied with a model, you can move to deploy it using Watson Machine Learning service.
4. Benefits
Efficiency: Streamlines the model development process, reducing the time from data to deployment.
Reproducibility: By tracking all aspects of the training process, it ensures experiments are reproducible.
Optimization: Automated tools like hyperparameter tuning help in getting the best performance out of your models.
Collaboration: Team members can view and build upon each other's experiments, fostering collaboration.
5. Considerations
Cost: Running multiple experiments, especially with large datasets or complex models, can consume more resources and might incur higher costs.
Complexity: While WML Experiments streamline many processes, there's still a learning curve, especially for those new to machine learning.
